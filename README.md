This is a demo application for showcasing the Speech Synthesis + Recognition APIs
built into modern browsers like Firefox and Google Chrome.

## Usage

1. Click the `recording` button
2. Your browser will ask for permission to use your microphone. Please grant it.
3. Say some words out loud - for now, best results with English.
4. Watch as your words are transcribed, and reversed
5. If your speakers you're on, you'll hear the app repeat what you just said,
   except reversed.
